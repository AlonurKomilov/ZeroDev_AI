Secrets Management Service

This module provides a centralized service for managing secrets, such as API keys,
database credentials, and other sensitive data. It is designed to integrate with
a production-grade secrets management system like HashiCorp Vault or AWS Secrets Manager.

For local development and testing, it can be configured to fall back to environment
variables or a local file-based mock service.
